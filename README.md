# gtkwave

Import of gtkwave 3.3.104 from sourceforge.

See it on [guix.gnu.org](https://guix.gnu.org/packages/gtkwave-3.3.104/), where it links to [sourceforge](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) as the site.

## Why?

Why not? (It weren't on github, so I couldn't fork it. Maybe github is not good for GNU and libre projectsâ€¦?)
